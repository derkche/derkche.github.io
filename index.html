      <p>Hi Princenipal Skimster. Hi Super Nintendo Chalmers! There's something about flying a kite at night that's just so unwholesome. I call it Billy and the Cloneasauras! Do you ever wonder why fat people have fat children? Or why chinese people have chinese children? They call 'em fingers but I've never seen them fing. Oh there they go. Conservation of mass it's the law! Marge I won't lie to you. Ahhhh I just love these lazy Saturdays... They're the suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked! Me fail english? That unpossible! I used to be with it but then they changed what it was. It'll happen to you! My eyes! The goggles do nothing! BART DO YOU WANT TO SEE MY NEW CHAINSAW AND HOCKEY MASK? I think it was called The Bus that Couldn't Slow Down. You're gonna have to speak up I'm wearing a towel. I live in a single room above a bowling alley and below another bowling alley. Hahaha dying tickles! You don't win friends with salad! I call the big one bitey! The ring came off my pudding cap! And Homer if you could kill someone on the way out that would be a huge help. Homer are you wearing a tie to impress Laddie? Am I too late for the 4:30 autogyro? I'll just go with a muumuu..</p>
